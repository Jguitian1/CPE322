# Lab 01 - GHDL and GTKWave

This lab requires you to install GHDL and to learn how to run files and view their waveform outputs

## Installation and Setup  

Instead of downloading GTKWave, I used software that I already used to run and create GHDL programs called Vivado. After opening the application I selected Create a New Vivado Project
