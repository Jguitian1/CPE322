# Lab 03 - Python Basics

Lab 3 asks to go over the basics of Python and to run example scripts and to install some packages  

## Setup  

Instead of using micromamba as a package manager, I use PyCharm. PyCharm has its own built in virtual envirnments for each project that is created, and automatically creates the necessary dependency files to recreate the project. PyCharm also lets you use a built in terminal to run any scripts that may require it.  

Below is what the project looks like after simply placing the required files into the lab

## Installing packages  

In this case, where the files are already made for me, including the imports, I can just hover the cursor over the red line and it will give me the option to install the missing package

As it is good to know how to use a terminal based package manager, installing packages this way is significantly easier for the sake of running basic Python Scripts. The image below shows where you can locate the packages you already have installed in the project directory

If I were to create my own script from scratch and didn't know what packages to install based on the red error lines, I would click on the settings button on the top right of PyCharm, select my project, go to Python Interpreter, and then press the "+" sign and search for the specific package I need. I can also view my installed packages here as well.
